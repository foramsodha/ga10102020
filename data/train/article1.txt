On Thursday, Rahul got into a scuffle with the police and was arrested along with Priyanka while they tried to visit the kin of the deceased.

The death of the victim and her hurried cremation by the police without letting the family perform her last rites has sparked widespread outrage across the nation, with the Opposition demanding the resignation of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

Earlier in the day, journalists were allowed to enter the village after the Uttar Pradesh administration said the Special Investigation Team (SIT) had completed its investigation into the case. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi and DGP Hitesh Chandra Awasthy also met the kin of the deceased today. Under fire for its handling of the murder and hurried cremation of the woman, the Uttar Pradesh government suspended three police officers, including Hathras Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir. A government spokesperson said polygraph and narco tests would be conducted on the accused, the victim’s relatives and police officers involved in the probe.
